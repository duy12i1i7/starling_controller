# Ardupilot examples

In general the files themselves should be fairly self explanatory. See the [root README.md](../README.md) for details on *linux/windows*. As a brief breakdown:

- **ap-gazebo** - Starts the core gazebo simulator/arducopter/mavros/ros-web-bridge stack only. Recommended for low level use or use primarily with a GCS (QGC or Mission Planner).
- **arducopter** - Starts the arducopter sitl only with a simple mavlink bridge. Recommended for use with only a GCS.
